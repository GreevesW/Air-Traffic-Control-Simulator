# Air-Traffic-Control-Simulator
Air Traffic Control training software including collision prediction

I used this project to experiment with unity and VSCode, and to improve my fluency in C#.

The project includes a top down radar display showing the position of aircraft, as well as a secondary display with flight strips and extra information about the aircraft. In the background a proximity detection system and a collision course detection system are used to prevent aircraft from colliding.
